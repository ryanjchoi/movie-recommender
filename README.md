# Movie Recommender Systems

##Overview
This prototype shows how to build recommender systems using Python libraries. 

##Usage
Open recommender-systems folder with `jupyter notebook`

##Dependencies
* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* scipy

Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install dependencies. 

##Recommend systems 
- Load music data
- The most popular movies in the dataset
- Popularity based recommender class
- A recommender with personalization
	* User based (user-item) collaborative filtering
	* Item based (item-item) collaborative filtering
- Quantitative comparison between the models
	* Precision - How much junk did we give to user?
	* Recall - How much of the good stuff did we miss?

##Credits
- The movie recommender systems are based on [dvysardana](https://github.com/dvysardana).
- The dataset is from [movielnes](https://movielens.org/)
